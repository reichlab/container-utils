# Steps to set up AWS ECS
Set up [Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) (Amazon ECS) using the following steps. This requires the published image from the "Steps to publish the image" step above. NB: The following can be complicated to get correct.

Notes:
- Below we use the prefix "container_demo_app".
- Make sure you select the same region to use for all the following steps.
- [ecs-diagram.jpg](ecs-diagram.jpg) outlines the ECS components involved.


## Create a security group
NB: these rules may not be safe for production, given this AWS warning:
> Rules with source of 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 allow all IP addresses to access your instance. We recommend setting security group rules to allow access from known IP addresses only.

- go to the VPC console > Security > Security groups
- click: "Create security group"
  - Security group name: container_demo_app
  - Description: group for https://github.com/reichlab/container-demo-app
  - VPC: choose default
  - Inbound rules: add the following two rules:
  > NFS | TCP | 2049 | Custom | 0.0.0.0/0
  > SSH | TCP | 22   | Custom | 0.0.0.0/0
  - Outbound rules: keep the default:
  > All traffic | All | All  | Custom | 0.0.0.0/0
  - click: "Create security group"


## Create a cluster
- go to the ECS console
- click: "Create cluster"
  - Cluster name: container_demo_app
  - Infrastructure: AWS Fargate (serverless)
  - click: "Create"


## Create an EFS file system
- go to the EFS console
- click: "Create file system"
  - Name: container_demo_app
  - VPC: choose default
  - click: "Create"
  - make note of the new id (e.g., fs-0a493be23f192e911)
- you now need to replace the automatically-selected default security groups
- go to the new file system's Network tab and click "Manage"
- for each security group in the six Availability zone rows' Security groups column:
  - click the "X" to remove it
  - click the "Choose security groups" dropdown
  - type "container_demo_app" and select the found group
- when you've replaced all six, click "Save"


## Populate the file system using a temporary EC2 instance
As described above, the app needs a `/data/config` directory with three files. You will be populating the EFS by launching a temporary EC2 instance that mounts the EFS, and then copying those files from the `/config` directory that you created.

create and launch the container_demo_app_temp ec2 instance that mounts slack_app EFS volume at /data :
- go to the EC2 console
- click: "Launch instance"
- name: container_demo_app_temp
- Number of instances: 1  # right sidebar
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Amazon Linux 2023 AMI
- Architecture: 64-bit (x86)
- Instance type: t2.micro
- Key pair name: select an existing key pair (e.g., baseline_root) or click "Create new key pair"
- Network settings > Edit > Subnet: us-east-1a  # @todo this is an arbitrary choice - I'm not sure this the best one
- Network: click "Select an existing security group", type "container_demo_app", and select the found group
- Configure storage > click "Edit" to the right of "0 x File systems"
  - click "Add shared file system"
  - File system: type "container_demo_app" and select the found file system
  - Mount point: /data

- click: "Launch instance"
- click the new instance and copy the "Public IPv4 DNS"
- open two terminals on your Mac and type the following in this order
- make sure you substitute your own .pem file's location and your DNS address

# terminal 1: ssh to the instance and chown `/data` to ec2-user  # @todo not sure chown is necessary
```bash
ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i /Users/cornell/Downloads/baseline_root.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-239-32-252.compute-1.amazonaws.com
sudo chown ec2-user -R /data
```

# terminal 2:
```bash
scp -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no" -i /Users/cornell/Downloads/baseline_root.pem  -r /Users/cornell/IdeaProjects/container-demo-app/config/  ec2-user@ec2-44-195-78-234.compute-1.amazonaws.com:/data
```

# terminal 1:
```bash
$ ls -al /data/config/
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  164 Sep 26 13:04 .env
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user   76 Sep 26 13:04 .git-credentials
-rw-r--r--. 1 ec2-user ec2-user   93 Sep 26 13:04 .gitconfig
```

- exit both terminals
- on the instance page, click "Instance state > Terminate instance", verify that you're operating on the container_demo_app_temp instance, and click "Terminate"


## Create the task definition
- go to the ECS console
- click "Task definitions" on the left sidebar:
- click "Create new Task Definition > Create new Task Definition"
  - Task definition family: container_demo_app
  - Launch type: AWS Fargate
  - Operating system/Architecture: Linux/X86_64
  - CPU: 0.5 vCPU , Memory: 1 GB
  - Task role: -
  - Task execution role: ecsTaskExecutionRole  # @todo not sure if this should be different
  - scroll down to "Storage - optional" and click "Add volume" to create a "Volume - 1" section
    - Volume type: EFS
    - Volume name: container_demo_app_efs_volume  |  File system ID: type "container_demo_app" and select the found file system
    - Root directory: /  |  Access point ID: None
      - scroll up to "Container - 1"
    - Name: container_demo_app_container
    - Image URI: reichlab/container-demo-app:1.0  # this is the docker hub image you created above
    - Port mappings: click "Remove"
    - Environment variables - optional: click "Add environment variable": Key: SECRET, Value type: Value, Value: shh! (from AWS)
  - scroll down to "Volume - 1" and click "Add mount point"
    - Container: container_demo_app_container  |  Source volume: container_demo_app_efs_volume  |  Container path: /data
      - scroll to the bottom and click "Create"


## Run a task and check the output logs
- on the task definition page, click "Deploy > Run task"
  - Existing cluster: container_demo_app
  - Launch type: FARGATE  |  Platform version: LATEST
  - click "Create"
- click the new task and wait for "Last status" to be "Running"
- click the Logs tab, click "View in CloudWatch", and look ath the output, which should look something like:
